## Editors
We are interested in text editors and not Word Processors.
Text Editors have an underlying text format of characters and lines, while Word Processors each have their own underlying format. The OpenOffice editor has an underlying XML format.
Having an underlying text format widens the ability to manipulate the underlying text.

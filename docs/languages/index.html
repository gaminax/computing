<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_language_features">Language Features</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Features add expressability to a programming language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Features do not add 'power'.
A Turing Machine has the same 'power' as any other programming language.
All programming languages have the same power.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Language designers are constantly adding features added to their languages,
in the hope of making programs shorter and more understandable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trend to add Functional Programming features
to languages is driven by a belief in the expressibility of funtional programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FP has been added to Java and CSharp.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_feature_convergence">Feature Convergence</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rob Pike, one of the designers of Golang,
notes that when languages keeping adding the same features,
then they all become the same language.
Rob is an advocate for fewer features.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Doug Crawford notes that JavaScript has a different view of Objects than Java, and this form of Object can be usefully explored in programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However JavaScript ( led by Microsoft&#8217;s TypeScript ),
through the addition of features each year is now converging on the General Object, and losing its disctinctiveness.</p>

<h2 id="_execution_speed_interpreted_and_compiled_programs">Execution Speed: Interpreted and Compiled programs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A new compile program starts up slower than a new interpreted program, but executes more quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interpreted langauges have more features, and are more expressive?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_libraries_and_the_language_ecosystem">Libraries and the Language Ecosystem</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A language often has an ecosystem surrounding it, which provides libraries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The C programming language is closely tied to the Linux OS.
Microsoft has not provided Windows support for the new versions of C, pushing users to adopt instead their version of C, C#.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java runs on many operating systems, but it is a world unto itself.
Microsoft is moving CLR to Linux Mono.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kotlin, Scala and Clojure runs on the java Ecosystem, and this gives access to the Java Libararies, which helps a new language gain traction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bash runs on Linux, but has been ported to Windows.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_expressiveness_and_execution_speed">Expressiveness and Execution Speed</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One language that bucks the trend is Golang, which makes a virtue of simplicity.
It takes pride in having as few features as possible.
Simple is no easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_over_specification">Over Specification.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Does more specifying really make for improvement?
TypeScript adds a Java like object layer to JavaScript, changing the basic object types of JavaScript in the process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Specification is the definition, and is often executable.
What then is the difference between the specification and the program?</p>

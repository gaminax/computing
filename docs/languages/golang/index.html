<p>Golang(2009), from Google, is a succesor to C.
It was designed by some of the creators of the original Unix Operating System
- Ken Thompson, Rob Pike, and Rob Griesmer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It strives to add as few features as possible to C. It does not follow in the tradition of C++, which has many features.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Golang is compiled, but has run time garbage collection.
( The GC is not as intrusive as that of Java ).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ordering of declarations
- the declaration order is switched around. One writes 'var x int' or 'x:=int' and not 'int c;'</p>
</div>

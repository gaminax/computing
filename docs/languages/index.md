<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many languages are having features added to them constantly.
Functional Programming features have been added to Java and CSharp.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many languages are converging, with the same set of universal features.
When languages have the same features, the only difference is the syntactic sugaring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One language that bucks the trend is Golang, which makes a virtue of simplicity.
It takes pride in having as few features as possible.
Simple is no easy.</p>

<h3 id="_over_specification">Over Specification.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Does more specifying really make for improvement?
TypeScript adds a Java like object layer to JavaScript, changing the basic object types of JavaScript in the process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Specification is the definition, and is often executable.
What then is the difference between the specification and the program?</p>
